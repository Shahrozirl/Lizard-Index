          <h1>Crested Gecko (Correlophus ciliatus)</h1>
          <h2>Difficulty: Easy</h2>
          <section><p>Crested geckos (Correlophus ciliatus) are small, nocturnal lizards native to New Caledonia. Easily recognized by the fringe-like crests that run from their eyes down to their tails, they’re known for their calm temperaments and ease of care. Once thought to be extinct, crested geckos are now a popular choice for beginners and experienced keepers alike due to their wide variety of colors, low-maintenance setup, and charming personalities.</p></section>

          <h2>Housing</h2>
          <p>Crested geckos are arboreal and require a vertically-oriented enclosure. The minimum enclosure size for one adult crested gecko is 18” x 18” x 24”. Larger is always better. The enclosure should include multiple climbing surfaces and hiding spots.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Lighting & UVB</h2>
          <p>Crested geckos are crepuscular, meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk. While they can survive without UVB lighting, providing low levels of UVB improves health and long-term wellbeing. A 5.0 T5 UVB tube placed over mesh or a ShadeDweller inside the enclosure is recommended.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Heating</h2>
          <p>Crested geckos thrive at room temperature. Ideal ambient temperature is 72-78°F (22-26°C) during the day, and a nighttime drop to 65-72°F (18-22°C) is fine. Supplemental heating is generally not necessary unless your home is unusually cold. Avoid temperatures above 82°F (28°C).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Humidity</h2>
          <p>Crested geckos require moderate to high humidity, ideally between 60-80%. Mist the enclosure with dechlorinated water 1-2 times daily. Ensure adequate airflow to prevent mold and respiratory issues. A digital hygrometer helps monitor humidity levels accurately.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Substrate</h2>
          <p>A moisture-retaining substrate such as coconut fiber, orchid bark, or a bioactive soil mix is ideal. Avoid loose dry substrates like sand. Spot-clean waste daily and change the substrate regularly to maintain hygiene.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Décor</h2>
          <p>Provide lots of climbing opportunities with branches, vines, and vertical hides. Artificial or live plants can help maintain humidity and offer cover. Ensure all items are securely placed to prevent injury.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Food</h2>
          <p>Crested geckos eat a specially-formulated powder diet mixed with water, available from brands like Pangea or Repashy. This should be their staple diet and can be offered 3-5 times per week. Supplement with occasional feeder insects (crickets, dubia roaches) once or twice a week. Dust feeders with calcium and multivitamin supplements as directed.</p>
