                <p>Reptiles are some of the most captivating and misunderstood creatures on Earth. From the ancient elegance of the Green Iguana to the curious charm of the Leopard Gecko, each species carries its own set of needs and behaviors. Unfortunately, misinformation and outdated care practices are still common. That’s why REPTI was created — to cut through the myths and provide modern, evidence-based resources that empower keepers to do better.</p>

                <p>At REPTI, we believe that reptile care is more than a hobby — it’s a responsibility. Reptiles are not decorations or low-maintenance pets; they are intelligent, sentient beings with complex needs. When you bring one into your home, you're making a commitment to support a living creature’s physical and psychological health for many years to come. We take that responsibility seriously — and we’re here to help you every step of the way.</p>
