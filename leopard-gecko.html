          <h1>Leopard Gecko (Eublepharis macularius)</h1>
          <h2>Difficulty: Easy</h2>
          <section>   
            <p>Leopard geckos are small, 7-10” lizards with a squat body, pebbled skin, short legs, and a plump, segmented tail. Although they are geckos, they are unique from other geckos in that they have eyelids and can’t walk up walls. Wild leopard geckos are typically dull yellow with brown or black spots and a creamy belly, but morph breeding has led to captive-bred leopard geckos being available in a variety of different colors and patterns.</p>    
            <p>Leopard geckos are native to semi-desert and arid grassland areas of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal. The spotted pattern which serves as their namesake also serves as camouflage among the packed earth, rocks, dry grasses, and shrubs characteristic to the landscape.</p>     
            <p>With good care, leopard geckos typically have a 15-20 year lifespan, although there are known cases of geckos that have lived longer. Due to their manageable size, relatively simple care requirements, and tolerance toward humans, leopard geckos are popular first-time reptiles.</p>

          <h2>Housing</h2>
          <p>Leopard geckos may seem small, but they still need an enclosure that is large enough to give them adequate opportunity to explore, hunt, and generally exercise natural behaviors. They are also terrestrial, which means that they are a ground-dwelling species, and generally prefer terrariums that are wider than they are tall. This is why the minimum recommended enclosure size for a single leopard gecko is 36”L x 18”W x 18”H. If possible, larger is always better.</p>
          <p>Although they are terrestrial, leopard geckos naturally dwell in rock stacks and are skilled climbers. Males should never be housed together due to fighting risks, and cohabitation of females should be avoided by novice keepers.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Lighting & UVB</h2>
          <p>Leopard geckos are crepuscular and prefer low UVB exposure. They benefit from UVB, but can survive without it if given proper D3 supplementation. Example setups include:</p>
          <ul class="gear-list">
            <li>Over mesh: Zoo Med ReptiSun T5 HO 5.0, 12” away</li>
            <li>Under mesh: Arcadia ShadeDweller Kit, 12” away</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Heating</h2>
          <p>Provide a basking surface of 94-97°F (34-36°C), a warm hide at 90-92°F (32-33°C), and a cool zone of 70-77°F (21-25°C). A 75w halogen bulb is typically sufficient. Use thermometers and dimmers for accurate control. At night, 60°F (16°C) is tolerable.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Humidity</h2>
          <p>Leopard geckos prefer a low humidity environment of 30-40%, with a humid hide at 70-80% to support shedding. Use a digital hygrometer to monitor humidity.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Substrate</h2>
          <p>Use a well-drained soil-like substrate such as:</p>
          <ul class="gear-list">
            <li>DIY mix: 40% organic topsoil, 40% play sand, 20% Excavator Clay</li>
            <li>Lugarti Natural Reptile Bedding</li>
            <li>Zoo Med ReptiSand or Exo Terra Desert Sand</li>
          </ul>
        <section>
          <h2>Décor</h2>
          <p>Provide hollow logs, branches, ledges, rocks, and plants for enrichment. Ensure there are at least two hides and plenty of climbing opportunities.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Food</h2>
          <p>Leopard geckos are insectivores. Feed juveniles daily and adults every 3-5 days. Use a variety of feeder insects such as crickets, roaches, larvae, and worms. Dust feeders with calcium and multivitamin supplements as directed.</p>
