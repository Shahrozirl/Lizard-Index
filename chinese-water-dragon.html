                <h1>Chinese Water Dragon (Physignathus cocincinus)</h1>
                <h2>Difficulty: Intermediate</h2>
                <p>Chinese water dragons are 2-3’ long lizards with slender, laterally compressed bodies, long tails, and well-developed limbs. They are usually bright green with vertical stripes and can develop a crest along their neck and back. These reptiles are semi-aquatic and arboreal, often found near bodies of water in tropical forests.</p>
                <p>They are native to Southeast Asia, including southern China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Burma. With proper care, water dragons can live up to 15 years in captivity.</p>

                <h2>Housing</h2>
                <p>Chinese water dragons require a vertically spacious enclosure, ideally 6’ tall or more. Glass or PVC enclosures with front access and ventilation are ideal. Provide ample climbing space with branches, vines, and elevated basking spots. Include a large water area for soaking and swimming.</p>
            </section>
        
            <section>
                <h2>Lighting & UVB</h2>
                <p>Provide 12 hours of bright white light and UVB daily. Use a T5 HO 12% UVB tube with a reflector mounted 12-18” from the basking area. UVB is essential for calcium metabolism and bone health.</p>
            </section>
        
            <section>
                <h2>Heating</h2>
                <p>Maintain a basking area of 90-95°F (32-35°C) and ambient temps of 80-88°F (27-31°C). Nighttime temperatures can drop to 75°F (24°C). Use halogen heat bulbs for basking and monitor with digital thermometers.</p>
            </section>
        
            <section>
                <h2>Humidity</h2>
                <p>Chinese water dragons require 60-80% ambient humidity. Use a digital hygrometer to monitor and mist the enclosure 1-2x daily. A fogger or misting system can help maintain levels. Ensure good ventilation to prevent mold.</p>
            </section>
        
            <section>
                <h2>Substrate</h2>
                <p>Use moisture-retentive substrates such as cypress mulch, coconut husk, or a bioactive mix. Spot clean daily and change substrate every 2-3 months. Avoid dry, dusty substrates that can irritate the dragon’s skin and lungs.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Décor</h2>
                <p>Decorate the enclosure with large branches, cork bark, plants (real or fake), and elevated basking areas. Provide both ground-level and elevated hiding spaces. A large soaking pool is essential.</p>
            </section>
        
            <section>
                <h2>Food</h2>
                <p>Chinese water dragons are omnivorous. Offer a variety of insects (crickets, roaches, silkworms, hornworms) and occasional greens (collard greens, mustard greens, dandelion). Some enjoy fruits like berries and mango in moderation. Dust insects with calcium powder (without D3) at most feedings and a multivitamin (with D3) once weekly.</p>
