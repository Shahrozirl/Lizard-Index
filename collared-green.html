          <h1>Collared Lizard (Crotaphytus spp.)</h1>
          <h2>Difficulty: Advanced</h2>
          <section><p>Collared lizards (Crotaphytus spp.) are striking, energetic reptiles known for their vivid colors and the distinctive black "collar" markings around their necks. Native to the arid and rocky regions of the southern United States and northern Mexico, these lizards are agile climbers and powerful runners—sometimes even sprinting on their hind legs! Their bold personalities and active behavior make them fascinating to observe, though they’re best suited for keepers with some reptile experience.</p></section>

          <h2>Housing</h2>
          <p>Collared lizards are highly active and require a spacious enclosure to allow for running and climbing. The minimum recommended size is 4’L x 2’W x 2’H, with emphasis on horizontal space.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Lighting & UVB</h2>
          <p>Collared lizards are diurnal and require strong UVB lighting to thrive. A T5 HO 10.0 or 12% UVB bulb should be mounted above the enclosure. For accurate UVB exposure, use a UVB meter to achieve a UVI of 3.0–4.0 in the basking zone.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Heating</h2>
          <p>These lizards need a hot basking area to properly digest food. Use a halogen bulb to achieve a basking surface temperature of 110–120°F (43–49°C). The cool side of the enclosure should range between 75–85°F (24–29°C).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Humidity</h2>
          <p>Collared lizards prefer dry environments with a relative humidity of 30–40%. Ensure proper ventilation and use a digital hygrometer to monitor levels. A humid hide can help with shedding.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Substrate</h2>
          <p>Provide a mix of sand and clay or soil that mimics their natural desert habitat. Suitable substrates include a DIY mix of play sand and organic topsoil or commercial desert blends like The Bio Dude Terra Sahara.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Decor</h2>
          <p>Collared lizards benefit from a variety of décor that supports climbing and hiding. Use rocks, logs, cork bark, and artificial or drought-resistant live plants to make their environment more enriching.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Food</h2>
          <p>Collared lizards are insectivores. Feed a variety of live insects such as crickets, roaches, black soldier fly larvae, silkworms, and occasional pinky mice. Supplement with calcium and multivitamins to prevent deficiencies. Juveniles eat daily, while adults can eat every other day.</p>
