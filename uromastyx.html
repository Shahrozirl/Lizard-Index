          <h1>Uromastyx (Uromastyx spp.)</h1>
          <h2>Difficulty: Intermediate</h2>
          <section><p>Uromastyx (Uromastyx spp.), also known as spiny-tailed lizards, are hardy, herbivorous reptiles native to the arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Recognized by their thick, spiky tails and stout bodies, these lizards come in a variety of vibrant colors depending on the species. Uromastyx thrive in hot, dry environments and require high temperatures and a plant-based diet. With their calm temperament and unique appearance, they make fascinating pets for intermediate to advanced reptile keepers.</p></section>

              <h2>Shopping List</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li>4’L x 2’W x 2’H reptile enclosure (larger preferred for adults)</li>

          <section>
              <h2>Housing</h2>
              <p>Uromastyx need large enclosures with high temperatures and strong lighting. The minimum size for an adult is 4x2x2 feet, but larger is better. They are terrestrial and love to dig, bask, and explore rocky terrain.</p>
          </section>
      
          <section>
              <h2>Lighting & UVB</h2>
              <p>Provide a high-output T5 UVB tube, such as Arcadia Desert 12% or Zoo Med Reptisun 10.0 T5, that spans at least half the enclosure’s length. UVB is essential for calcium metabolism and overall health. Bulbs should be replaced every 12 months.</p>
          </section>
      
          <section>
              <h2>Heating</h2>
              <p>Uromastyx are desert reptiles and need a very hot basking area of 120-130°F (49-54°C), with a cool side in the high 70s to low 80s°F (25-28°C). Use halogen bulbs and ensure surface temps are accurate with a temperature gun.</p>
          </section>
      
          <section>
              <h2>Humidity</h2>
              <p>These lizards thrive in arid environments with humidity levels between 10-30%. Avoid misting or high humidity, as it can lead to respiratory issues.</p>
          </section>
      
          <section>
              <h2>Substrate</h2>
              <p>Use clean, dry sand, excavator clay, or an arid bioactive substrate. Avoid loose substrates for babies or sick individuals. Substrate should be deep enough to allow for burrowing (at least 4").</p>
          </section>
      
          <section>
              <h2>Décor</h2>
              <p>Provide plenty of rocks, hides, and raised platforms for basking and enrichment. Flat stones placed under the basking light help with thermoregulation. Secure all decor firmly to prevent injury.</p>
          </section>
      
          <section>
              <h2>Food</h2>
              <p>Uromastyx are herbivorous. Their diet should include dark leafy greens (collard, mustard, turnip), hibiscus, squash, and lentils. Occasional treats like bee pollen or edible flowers can be offered. Avoid animal protein and fruit. Calcium and vitamin supplements should be used sparingly.</p>
