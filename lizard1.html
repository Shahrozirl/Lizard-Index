        <h2>Diet and Feeding</h2>
        <p>Bearded dragons are omnivorous, meaning they eat both plant-based and animal-based foods. Their diet consists of insects such as crickets and mealworms, as well as leafy greens, fruits, and vegetables. Younger dragons require more protein from insects, while adults need a higher proportion of plant matter. Proper nutrition is essential for their health, as deficiencies can lead to metabolic bone disease and other issues.</p>

        <h2>Behavior and Temperament</h2>
        <p>Bearded dragons are known for their friendly and curious personalities. They are generally easy to handle and can recognize their owners over time. These lizards display various behaviors, such as head bobbing and arm waving, which are used to communicate with other dragons. Unlike some reptiles, they are diurnal, meaning they are active during the day, making them great pets for owners who want to interact with them frequently.</p>

        <h3>Lifespan and Health</h3>
        <p>With proper care, bearded dragons can live between 10 to 15 years in captivity. Regular vet check-ups, a balanced diet, and proper lighting are crucial for their longevity. Common health problems include respiratory infections, parasites, and metabolic bone disease, often caused by poor husbandry. Keeping their enclosure clean and monitoring their behavior for signs of illness can help ensure a long and healthy life.</p>
